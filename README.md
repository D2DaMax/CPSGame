## General Info
Project proposed by Bruce McMillin, ff@mst.edu, Professor of Computer Science

This is a game designed for Android devices.  A multi-semester project at Missouri S&T for the CS4096/7 class.

Our project aims to educate children ages K-8 on the importance of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) security.

The game is meant to simulate a water treatment facility where one player is an attacker and the other a defender.
